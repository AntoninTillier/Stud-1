**Project : Shindra**

Based on the Shindra board game available at www.shindra.com, the project involves developing a single-player version for human players to play against the computer.

**Objective of the Game**

Control as many squares as possible on a 4x4 board.

**Rules**

Each player has 18 cards (two cards numbered 2, two cards numbered 3..., two cards numbered 10).

**Step 1: Choosing Cards**

Each player selects 9 cards based on their strategy. A balanced strategy involves keeping one card of each value. An offensive strategy involves keeping higher-value cards.

**Step 2: Placing Cards on the Board**

The first player (computer or human) places a card on the board. Subsequent players place cards on a free square adjacent (right, left, top, bottom) to other cards. If your card touches a weaker opponent's card (right, left, top, bottom), their card changes to your color. This rule can apply to neighboring cards as well.

If your card is in contact with two cards, and the difference between those two cards is equal to the value of your card, then the opponent's cards change to your color (virus).

Cards are played by both players in turns until the board is filled.

**Display**

We suggest displaying the values of your cards normally and surrounding the computer's card values with parentheses. Here's a possible example for the beginning of step 2.
