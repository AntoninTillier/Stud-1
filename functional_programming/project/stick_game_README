To use our project, you need OCaml on your computer.
You must also have an interpreter (Emacs, MacCaml, ...) or a terminal.
To launch our project in the terminal, type the following:

ocaml
#load "graphics.cma";; (* loads graphics module *)
#load "unix.cma";;(* load Unix module *)
open Unix;;(* opens Unix module *)
chdir "path to project file";;(* absolute path to project file *)
#use "jeu_allumette.oml";;(* Executes the program in the file *)


The project is played in graphic mode with mouse clicks.
All requested functions are implemented.
To manage the sticks, we use lists.
